# Introduction

In this exericse , we will explore the sample todolist application built with ionic 4 framework and perform following tasks:

* Generate client SDK based on the openAPI specification 
* Connect todolist app with the mock server created in previous exercise.
* Extend code by to allow update an item in the todolist app.

# Pre-reqs

[Nodejs - 8.0+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Step 1 - Explore the app

 Git clone the api-first-todo project to your local machine and checkout the master branch using the following.

```
git clone https://github.com/rhappdev/api-first-workshop-angular

cd api-first-todo

npm install

```
## Step 2 - Generate client sdk.
Generate client sdk based on specification created in exercise 1. For reference, this repo contains a complete version todolist.yaml in folder. 

```
openapi-generator generate -g typescript-angular --additional-properties=prependFormOrBodyParameters=true,ngVersion=7.0.0 -o ./src/app/rest1 -i ./api-code-gen/todolist.yaml

```
<p style="color:gray">
Explore sdk generated by openapi-generator tool in folder src/app/rest .
</p>

## Step 3 - Verify app is running without any errors.

```
ionic serve

```
## Step 4 - Review code in angular service comopnent.
Review code in src/app/services/item.service.ts to get an idea on how the REST call is made by utilizing the sdk generated in the previous step.

## Step 5 - Connect to Mock server

Connect to Mock server by changing the value for <b>API_URL</b> in src/app/enviroment/environment.ts file

## Step 6 - Run app and verify you are able to get list of items and add item.
```
ionic serve
```

## Step 7 - Extend app to allow user to update an item

  * Include function to get item by id in src/app/services/item.service.ts:
    
  ```
      getItemById(id): Observable<Item> {
       return this.todoAPI.getItem(id)
     }
  ```

  * Include function update item by id in src/app/services/item.service.ts  :
    
  ```
    updateItem(newValues){
    return this.todoAPI.updateItem(newValues.id, newValues);
    }
  ```

   <p style="color:gray">Note: To have a better understanding, review code in update-item.page.ts to see how itemService is being called</p>

## Step 8 - Finally run app
```
ionic serve
```
<p style="color:gray">You should able to update an item by connecting to mock server. Verify by watching the network tab in  chrome dev tools</p>

# Overview

In this workshop you will create a todo-list application by  building a nodejs cloud app and ionic angular frontend using openAPI specification. 


**You will learn how to**
 
 * Exercise 1 : Define contract for the REST API using [apicurio](https://studio.apicur.io)

 * Exercise 2 : Use Postman to spin up a mock server based on openAPI specification

 * Exercise 3: Build a ionic-angular frontend app to communicate with  backend REST API using [openapi-generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli). This tool helps to generate server stubs and client SDKS defined for API with OpenAPI specification

 * Exercise 4: Build a nodejs app from scratch using [oas-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oas-tools) module. The module allows to support REST API defined with openAPI spec.
